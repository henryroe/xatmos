These are notes that are NOT to be distributed with package. 

They are just some breadcrumbs to myself on how to re-build/install/upload etc.

To build/clean-up use `make` commands, e.g.:

    make clean
    make dist
    
For testing:

    make dist
    cd dist
    tar -xzvf xatmos-0.1.0.tar.gz
    cd xatmos-0.1.0
    python setup.py install
    # and, then test it out:
    python -c "import xatmos"

To set up a virtual environment using the canopy tools:

    cd ~/Dropbox/py/xatmos
    /Applications/Canopy.app/Contents/MacOS/Canopy_cli venv xatmos_venv

To activate:
    
    source ~/Dropbox/py/xatmos/xatmos_venv/bin/activate
    
To deactivate:

    deactivate
    
In the venv, need to install the various packages for testing:

    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install pyface
    pip install traits    # wasn't actually needed, b/c pyface
    pip install traitsui
    pip install matplotlib  # failing here and probably not getting time to get back to it.
